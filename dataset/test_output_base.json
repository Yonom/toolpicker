The efficiency of the motor is 75%, which means the output power (P_out) is 75% of the input power: P_out = 0.75 * P_in = 0.75 * 120W = 90W.\n\n3.

Similarly, when we compose $g$ with $h$, we get $g(h(x))$. Let's assume the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^n$. Then, the highest power of $x$ in $g(h(x))$ will be $(x^n)^3 = x^{3n}$.\n5.

We are left with $max(3n, 6n) = 36$.\n10. Since $3n$ and $6n$ are both multiples of $3n$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3n$ to get $max(1, 2) = 12/n$.\n11.

We have the equation 7m + 12n = 22, and we want to find the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \u2208 A}.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a solution to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. We can start by noticing that 7(1) + 12(1) = 19, which is close to 22. If we add 3 to 19, we get 22, so let's try to add 3 to the left-hand side: 7(1) + 12(1) + 3 = 22. Now, we can rewrite this as 7(1) + 12(1) + 7(-1) = 22, which gives us m = 0 and n = 1.\n\nNow that we have one solution, we can try to find more solutions. Notice that if we subtract 7 from m and add 1 to n, the equation remains true: 7(m-1) + 12(n+1) = 7m + 12n - 7 + 12 = 22. This means that if (m, n) is a solution, then (m-1, n+1) is also a solution.\n\nUsing this, we can generate more solutions. For example, starting from (0, 1), we can get (\u22121, 2), (\u22122, 3), (\u22123, 4), and so on.\n\nNow, let's think about the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \u2208 A}. We want to find the greatest negative number in this set. Since m + n is decreasing as m and n decrease, we want to find the smallest m and n that satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try to find the smallest m and n. We can start from (0, 1) and keep decreasing m and increasing n until we reach the smallest possible values. We get (\u22121, 2), (\u22122, 3), (\u22123, 4), (\u22124, 5), and (\u22125, 6).\n\nNow, let's calculate m + n for each of these solutions: (\u22121) + 2 = 1, (\u22122) + 3 = 1, (\u22123) + 4 = 1, (\u22124) + 5 = 1, and (\u22125) + 6 = 1. We see that the greatest negative number in the set B is \u22125 + 6 = 1, but this is not among the choices.\n\nWait, what's going on? We were supposed to find a negative number, but we got 1! Let's re-examine our solutions. We had (\u22125, 6), (\u22124, 5), (\u22123, 4), (\u22122, 3), and (\u22121, 2). Notice that if we decrease m and n further, we'll get (\u22126, 7), (\u22127, 8), and so on. But then m + n will be even smaller!\n\nThis means that the greatest negative number in the set B is actually the smallest m + n we found, which is \u22125 + 6 = 1. But this is not among the choices.

But is this true? What if we try to find a solution with a smaller m + n?\n\nAfter re-examining our work, we realize that we made a mistake.

We are not given the focal length of the objective lens, but we can use the fact that the lenses are separated by 100 cm. Since the objective lens is a converging lens, its focal length is likely to be greater than the distance between the lenses.\n\nLet's assume the focal length of the objective lens is 100 cm (a reasonable assumption, but we'll see if it leads to a correct answer).\n\n5.

We want to find the behavior of the electric field strength at a distance r from the center.\n\nFor r < R, the electric field strength is due to the charge within the sphere of radius r. Since the charge density increases linearly with r, the total charge within the sphere will increase faster than linearly with r. By Gauss's law, the electric field strength will also increase faster than linearly with r.\n\nFor r > R, the electric field strength is due to the total charge within the sphere of radius R.

The number of ways to make the first assignment is 10. The number of ways to make the second assignment is 9, and so on, until we reach the 20th assignment.\n5.

The student has made 10 measurements, and the values are 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. These values represent the number of disintegrations per second.\n\n3. To establish the rate, the student needs to find the average rate of disintegration.

There are 10 measurements, so the average rate is 20/10 = 2 disintegrations per second.\n\n5. To establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1%, the student needs to count for a time long enough to reduce the uncertainty in the average rate to 1% of the rate. The uncertainty in the average rate is proportional to 1/\u221an, where n is the number of measurements.\n\n6. Let's assume the student wants to reduce the uncertainty to 1% of the rate, which is 0.02 disintegrations per second (1% of 2 disintegrations per second). The current uncertainty is the standard deviation of the measurements divided by \u221a10 (since there are 10 measurements). The standard deviation of the measurements can be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each measurement and the average rate.\n\n7.

Using the right-hand rule, we can determine that the force will be to the left of the electron's velocity vector.\n\n4. This force will cause the electron to accelerate in a circular path. The direction of the force is perpendicular to the velocity, so the electron will move in a circle.\n\n5.

The condition for constructive interference is that the thickness of the oil layer (500 nm) is equal to an odd multiple of half the wavelength (\u03bb/2).\n6.

Since the acceleration is uniform, we can find the acceleration using the equation: a = \u0394v / \u0394t, where \u0394v is the change in velocity (20.0 m/s - 0 m/s = 20.0 m/s) and \u0394t is the time (15.0 s).\n5. Calculate the acceleration: a = 20.0 m/s / 15.0 s = 1.33 m/s^2.\n6. Now, plug in the values into the equation of motion: s = 0(15.0) + (1/2)(1.33)(15.0)^2.\n7.

We know that W consists of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This means that we have three constraints on the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\n3.

From the first constraint, we know that d = 0. From the second and third constraints, we can solve for b and c in terms of a. This means that the dimension of W is 1, since there is only one free coefficient (a).\n\n5.

The number of nonterminal nodes is the total number of nodes minus the number of leaf nodes. In a complete K-ary tree, all nodes at depth N-1 are leaf nodes, and there are K^(N-1) of them.\n\n3.

Since the horse is attached to the cart, the horse's movement will affect the cart's movement.\n4. The horse's muscles will contract to generate a force that will propel the horse forward.\n5.

The ions are projected with the same speed, so they have the same initial velocity (v).\n2. The magnetic field (B) is uniform, and the initial velocity is perpendicular to B.\n3. The force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force equation: F = qvB.\n4. Since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, it will cause the ion to move in a circular path.\n5. The radius of the circular path (r) is related to the force, mass (m), and velocity by the equation: F = mv^2/r.\n6. Since F = qvB, we can substitute this into the previous equation: qvB = mv^2/r.\n7. Now, we want to find the combination of mass and charge that results in the largest radius (r).\n8. Rearranging the equation to solve for r, we get: r = mv / (qB).\n9. Since v and B are the same for all ions, the radius (r) is directly proportional to m/q.\n10.

We want to find the velocity at which an observer must move parallel to the rod to measure its length as 0.80 m.\n3. This is a classic problem of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL_obs = L_proper * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L_obs is the observed length, L_proper is the proper length, v is the velocity of the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\n4. We're given that L_obs = 0.80 m and L_proper = 1.00 m. We need to find v.\n\n5. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n0.80 m = 1.00 m * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n6.

This bending of waves is known as diffraction.\n\nOn the other hand, light waves don't seem to bend around the corner, which is why we can't see around it. This difference in behavior might be related to the properties of sound and light waves.\n\nHmm... which option seems most plausible?\n\nAh-ha! Option B: \"Sound has a longer wavelength, which increases the diffraction\" seems like a reasonable explanation. The longer wavelength of sound waves might allow them to bend around the corner more easily, making it possible to hear sounds around the corner. Meanwhile, light waves have a shorter wavelength, which might make it harder for them to bend around the corner, making it impossible to see around it.\n\nSo, I'll choose option B as the most reasonable explanation for this observation.", "I'll choose the \"chain-of-thought\" option.\n\nLet's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1.

Observer O' is moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis and sees one source flash 13 ns before the other.\n4.
